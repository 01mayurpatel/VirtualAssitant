Respected Principal,

I am XXXX, student of your college studying in class X. I am writing this letter to request you for two days leave starting from 13th May 2021 to 14th May 2021. As my parents are going out of town for two days and they want me to accompany them.

Therefore, I kindly request you to grant me leave for these two days. I assure you that I shall fulfill all my pending tasks timely as I also realize my duties and responsibilities towards my studies. I shall do my best to complete all my tasks in time.

I shall be thankful to you for your kind favour and I hope for your positive response.

Thanking you. 

Yours obediently,
